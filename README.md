# Enhanced-Cryptographic-Model

An enhanced cryptographic model combining RSA, AES & ElGamal Algorithms.
This system encrypts a plain document with an AES key, which is then encrypted using the RSA public key.
At the receiving end, the AES key and document are decrypted using the RSA private key and decrypted AES key, respectively.
This new system provides a secure and efficient approach for data communication and contributes to the advancement of cryptographic techniques.
